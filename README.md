# TheLostCalendar

Let me tell you the story of Google Admin and the raiders of the lost Calendar !
It all began when an adventurer deleted a team calendar instead of unsubscribe from it in Google Calendar.
All was lost for the fellowship and its members because the calendar cannot be restore once vanished.
And the adventurer memory was not enough to recreate all the eventsâ€¦

Hope was lost but with thorough research and some digging, we found some lead : restore the events instead of the calendar !

First you have get the deleted calendar ID in Google Workspace Calendar Logs. 
To find it, filter the search with the user who deleted the calendar and the event : Calendar Deleted.
